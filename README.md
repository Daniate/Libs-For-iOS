# Libs-For-iOS

| Name | Version | Supported Architectures | Enable Bitcode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mbedtls | 2.12.0 | i386;x86_64;armv7;armv7s;arm64 | YES |
| libuv | 1.23.0 | i386;x86_64;armv7;armv7s;arm64 | YES |
| openssl | 1.1.1 | i386;x86_64;armv7;~~armv7s~~;arm64 | YES |

I built mbedtls libs with the project generated by `cmake -G Xcode <mbedtls-path>` command.

I built libuv lib with the project generated by `cmake -G Xcode <libuv-path>` command.

I built openssl libs by scripts, you can find them in the `openssl/scripts` directory, when you use them, you should put them in the openssl source root directory(may be `~/Downloads/openssl-1.1.1`).
