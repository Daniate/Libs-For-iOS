I built mbedtls libs with the project generated by `cmake -G Xcode <mbedtls-source-dir>` command.

I built libuv with the project generated by `cmake -G Xcode <libuv-source-dir>` command.

I built openssl libs by scripts, you can find them in the `openssl/scripts` directory, when you use them, you should put them in the openssl source root directory(may be `~/Downloads/openssl-1.1.1`).

I built polarssl lib with the project generated by `cmake -G Xcode <polarssl-source-dir>` command.

I built librtmp with polarssl-1.3.9, when you use it, you should add polarssl.

I built libyuv with the project generated by `cmake -G Xcode <libyuv-source-dir>` command.
