I built mbedtls libs with the project generated by `cmake -G Xcode <mbedtls-path>` command.

I built libuv lib with the project generated by `cmake -G Xcode <libuv-path>` command.

I built openssl libs by scripts, you can find them in the `openssl/scripts` directory, when you use them, you should put them in the openssl source root directory(may be `~/Downloads/openssl-1.1.1`).

I built polarssl lib with the project generated by `cmake -G Xcode <polarssl-path>` command.

I built librtmp lib with polarssl-1.3.9, when you use it, you should add polarssl.
